NOTE:

ROM dumps are no longer embedded but must be supplied by the user.
By default sidplayfp will look for the files under $XDG_DATA_HOME
(or $HOME/.local/share/sidplayfp/ if not defined) on Linux and
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\sidplayfp\
on Windows. You can override the defaults by changing the settings
in sidplayfp.ini(5).
The only mandatory ROM is the kernal, basic and chargen are optional and
most tune should work fine without.
