Description: SID (MOS 6581) emulation library
 This is a (shared) library that implements the emulation of the C64's
 SID chip (MOS 6581) and CPU (6510). It is used by several "player"
 applications, e.g. sidplay, which make it possible to listen to *really*
 a lot (13.600+) of tunes, known from old and new C64 programs (as well
 as Amiga compositions).
 .
 Find most of the available musics from your favourite games or demos
 and more in the High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC). For downloads and
 information about the volunteers, who maintain the collection, look at
 the HVSC homepage http://www.hvsc.c64.org.

Package: libsidutils-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libsidutils0 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: utility functions for SID players
 This library contains various things deemed useful to all SID players
 (Emulations of the C64's SID chip (MOS 6581) and CPU (6510)), and
 currently every player seems to be re-inventing. It is used by
 several "player" applications, e.g. sidplay.
 .
 Support so far is:
 .
  * INI file reader.
  * MD5 key creation.
  * Song length database parser.
  * Sid filter file parser.
 .
 Coming soon:
 .
  * Playlist parser (load and save).
  * STIL parser.
