Note from alankila, 18.9.2010:

I'm gradually considering sidplay2 codebase to be obsolete. I am officially
abandoning this project today.

I'm primarily working on jsidplay2, which has now also been integrated to
Acid64 via jsiddevice, a SID emulator on the other end of a network socket,
which is basically a minimalistic jsidplay2 as well. The java project is
strongly recommend for checking out, as it has video output, cartride, disk and
tape support in addition to SID playing capabilities.

This codebase has a variety of bugs in CPU and with its headless VIC emulation.
These bugs are unlikely to ever get fixed, due to the lipstick-on-a-pig feeling
that it evokes. (The Java codebase has rewritten CPU and VIC.) Hoever, it is of
note that someone ported our port of VICE's MOS6526 into this codebase, so that
is now fairly good and is expected to pass the Lorentz test suite. So people
who want to work on a sidplay2 are encouraged to pick the mos6526.cpp from this
tree.

In short, use jsidplay2, or acic64+jsiddevice, or VICE's vsid. I know the vsid
is right now horribly primitive, but I'm pretty sure a superior SID player
can be evolved from VICE with less effort than it takes to upgrade the CPU and
VIC of sidplay2, and to perhaps fix other small problems.

See you in VICE, or the land of Java.
