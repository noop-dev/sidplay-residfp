This INI file reader has been designed to handle large configuration files
on Windows and non Windows platforms.  All standard Mircosoft functionality
is provided.

Additional support includes:

Non standard comments e.g. '#' and comments appearing at the end of a key.


Anonymous sections e.g.:

; This key has no section header
key1 = data

[section1]
key1 = data ; comment


Auto parsing of data lists:

key1 = data, data2, data3


Features:

Comments at the end of keeps will not be recognised unless there is atleast
one character of whitespace preceeding the start of the comment.

All comments in the same INI file must be of the same type, and you are
required to define the type of comment you expect.

Additional data types.


Bugs:

Due to the caching feature, only usable data is read from the INI file.
Should you make a change to this data, only the usable data is written back
to the file.  This means all comments will be lost!
