	<title>Description</title>

	<para>STILView is a command-line driven program to help you retrieve the entries
	 stored in STIL fast and accurately. STILView uses the STIL C++ class heavily to
	 do this, and in fact, the primary purpose of this command-line program is to
	 test that class (which is, BTW, used in many GUI-based SID players, most
	 notably in SIDPlay for Windows and XSIDPLAY for Unix systems). However, it is
	 user-friendly enough to be used by non-programmers, too.</para>

	<para>I am not sure about what other people do, but I use this command-line STILView
	 primarily as a tool under Solaris 2.6 to print out the STIL information for a
	 SID file I am listening to with the UNIX command-line version of SIDPlay...</para>

	<title>Glossary</title>

	<para>Some terms and STIL-related lingo in alphabetical order:</para>

	<para>BUG ENTRY - There exists a special file in HVSC (/DOCUMENTS/BUGlist.txt) that
	 lists all known bugs in SID tunes in HVSC. See the top of that file for details
	 about what's in it exactly. A BUG entry is like a STIL entry, but it is
	 contained in this BUGlist.txt file.</para>

	<para>FIELD - The smallest piece of information in a STIL entry. Currently valid
	 field names are NAME, TITLE, ARTIST and COMMENT.</para>

	<para>FILE-GLOBAL COMMENT - A special COMMENT field in a STIL entry for a multi-tune
	 SID file that refers to the whole SID, not just one tune in it. These usually
	 contain general information about the SID file itself.</para>

	<para>Example:</para>

	<screen>/Hubbard_Rob/Gerry_the_Germ.sid
COMMENT: In Rob's own demo of this music, the tunes are named after the levels
         in the original game.
(#1)
  TITLE: Lungs
(#2)
  TITLE: Kidney
(#7)
  TITLE: End</screen>

	<para>HVSC - High Voltage SID Collection. If you don't know what this is, you
	 downloaded the wrong program. :)</para>

	<para>HVSC-RELATIVE PATHNAME - The pathname plus filename of a SID file that can be
	 found in your HVSC, relative to the base directory of HVSC. It is always in
	 UNIX-style format, eg.: /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid refers to Rob Hubbard's
	 Commando.sid file within HVSC (which may actually be found as
	 C:\Music\HVSC\Hubbard_Rob\Commando.sid on your Windows PC).</para>

	<para>MULTI-TUNE ENTRY - A STIL entry that is referring to a SID file that has many
	 tunes in it. Each tune might have its own STIL block, which are separated by a
	 so-called tune designation in the form of "(#x)", where x = the tune number.
	 Consult the STIL.FAQ in HVSC for a detailed description.</para>

	<para>Example:</para>

	<screen>/Hubbard_Rob/Gerry_the_Germ.sid
COMMENT: In Rob's own demo of this music, the tunes are named after the levels
         in the original game.
(#1)
  TITLE: Lungs
(#2)
  TITLE: Kidney
(#7)
  TITLE: End</screen>

	<para>SECTION - A part of STIL that belongs to one composer (ie. every STIL entry
	 referring to SID files that are in one subdirectory in HVSC). Sections in STIL
	 are always separated by a line in the form of: "### Composer's name ########".</para>

	<para>SECTION-GLOBAL COMMENT - A special STIL entry that refers not to an individual
	 SID file, but to a whole subdirectory. These usually contain info about the
	 composer himself, or about all the SID file he/she ever composed, and are
	 always indexed in the form of "/Subdir/" (note the trailing slash!).</para>

	<para>Example:</para>

	<screen>/Hubbard_Rob/
COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Hubbard to be his. People
         have often stolen Hubbard's routine causing some tunes to be falsely
         credited to him.
         Hubbard's own comments are denoted by (RH).</screen>

	<para>SINGLE-TUNE ENTRY - A STIL entry that has no tune designation in it in the
	 form of "(#x)", where x is a number. (Note, that a single-tune entry might still
	 refer to a SID file which has many tunes in it, ie. when a single-tune entry
	 has nothing but a COMMENT field in it!)</para>

	<para>Example:</para>

	<screen>/Hubbard_Rob/Chain_Reaction.sid
  TITLE: Zoolook (remix) [from Zoolook]
 ARTIST: Jean Michel Jarre</screen>

	<para>Another example (the SID this is refering to has many tunes in it!):</para>

	<screen>/Barrett_Steve/Magic_Land_Dizzy.sid
COMMENT: Also used in the game "Wacky Darts" (c) 1990 Codemasters.</screen>

	<para>STIL - SID Tune Information List, essentially a text-file database that can be
	 found in your HVSC in the /DOCUMENTS/ subdirectory.</para>

	<para>STIL ENTRY - All of the pieces of information in STIL relating to one SID file
	 of the HVSC. They are always indexed by the HVSC-relative pathname.</para>

	<para>TUNE - One of the compositions in a SID. Most SID files have only one tune in
	 them, but many have more than one (eg. one for the title score of the game, and
	 one for the hi-score music).</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do *not* print BUG entries</para>
	      <para>Default value: Not specified (ie. do print BUG entries)
	       Example: stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -b</para>
	      <para>When this option is specified, BUG entries will not be printed for the given
	       SID tune. At a minimum, the -e option has to be specified for this option to
	       work.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>-d</option></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Default value: Not specified (ie. debug mode is off)</para>
	      <para>Example: stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid -d</para>

	      <para>Turns on debug mode in STILView. This will result in an extensive output, with
	       the debugging messages going to STDERR. If you encounter any problem or strange
	       behavior with STILView, run STILView with the exact same options as you did
	       when you encountered the problem, with this -d option added to them. Capture
	       the complete output of this run, and send it to me with a detailed explanation
	       of the problem (see email address at the top of this file).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>-e</option>=<replaceable>entry</replaceable></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Default: NONE (you have to give an HVSC-relative pathname to this option)</para>
	      <para>Example #1: stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid
	       Example #2: stilview -e=/Hubbard_Rob/</para>

	      <para>This is where you specify the STIL entry you are looking for, given as an
	       HVSC-relative pathname. If there exists no STIL entry for the given filename,
	       STILView will print out nothing. Otherwise, you'll get the STIL entry (or parts
	       of it, as you may have specified it by other options). HVSC-relative pathnames
	       are case-insensitive, so /HUBBARD_ROB/Commando.sid is the same as
	       /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid.</para>

	      <para>Example #1 is the most frequent way of retrieving STIL entries, and it will
	       return all of the STIL entry for Commando.sid, as well as the section-global
	       comment for /Hubbard_Rob/. Example #2 is another valid thing to do: this will
	       return only the section-global comment for /Hubbard_Rob/.</para>
	    </listitem>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>-h</option></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Default: NONE
	       Example: stilview -h</para>

	       <para>Prints a brief help screen listing the available options. All other options
	       that are also specified on the command-line are ignored.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>-f</option>=<replaceable>field</replaceable></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Default: all</para>
	      <para>Valid values for &lt;field&gt; are: all, name, author, title, artist, comment</para>
	      <para>Example #1: stilview -l -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -f=comment</para>
	      <para>Example #2: stilview -l -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=1 -f=title</para>
	      <para>Example #3: stilview -l -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid -t=12 -f=all -s -b</para>

	      <para>Asks for one particular field in a STIL entry. Combined with the -t option,
	       these two options can retrieve any portion of a STIL entry, including a single
	       field in a specific subtune's entry. Below is full and complete explanation of
	       what the different possible combinations of the -t and -f options retrieve:</para>

	      <para>-t=0 -f=all : All of the STIL entry is printed.</para>
	      <para>-t=0 -f=comment : The file-global comment is printed. For single-tune entries
	           that have nothing but a COMMENT field in them, this prints that COMMENT.
	           For single-tune entries that have other fields in them, this prints nothing.
	           (This is because single-tune entries with nothing but a COMMENT field are
	           assumed to be file-global comments.)</para>
	      <para>-t=0 -f=&lt;name/author/title/artist&gt; : Nothing is printed. This combination of
	           these options is invalid.</para>
	      <para>-t=&lt;x&gt; -f=all : (Where x is anything but 0.) All fields from the portion of the
	           STIL entry for the given tune number &lt;x&gt; are printed. For single-tune
	           entries, asking for -t=1 -f=all is equivalent to saying -t=0 -f=all, since
	           by definition, the whole entry refers to only one tune. (However, specifying
	           -t with any other number than 1 will print nothing!) Note that if there's a
	           file-global comment in the STIL entry (which also means that if a
	           single-tune entry has nothing but a COMMENT field in it), that is *not*
	           printed with these combinations of options.</para>
	      <para>-t=&lt;x&gt; -f=&lt;name/author/title/artist/comment&gt; : (Where x is anything but 0.) The
	           specific field from the portion of the STIL entry for the given tune number
	           is printed. For single-tune entries that have nothing but a COMMENT in them,
	           this returns nothing.</para>

	      <para>Of course, if the STIL entry or any portion of it asked with these options does
	       not exist, STILView will print nothing. Also, unless otherwise specified with
	       the -o, -s and -b options, the section-global comment and the BUG entry of the
	       given SID file will also get printed (provided they exist).</para>

	      <para>In example #1, the file-global comment for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed,
	       since -t is not specified and is assumed to be 0. Also printed are the section-
	       global comment and the BUG entry for the same SID file (if they exist). In
	       example #2, the TITLE field of the STIL entry for tune #1 of
	       /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed along with the section-global comment and the
	       BUG entry for the same SID file (if they exist). In example #3, all of the STIL
	       entry for tune #12 of /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid is printed, but nothing else.</para>

	      <para>Starts STILView in interactive mode, ignoring all other options specified on
	       the command-line, except -l, -d and -m. In interactive mode, you can look for
	       STIL entries by typing them in. You will get prompted for the desired STIL
	       entry (which has to be specified with an HVSC-relative pathname), for the tune
	       number requested (which should be any non-negative number, but this is not
	       enforced), and finally for the specific STIL field you want to retrieve.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <term><option>-l</option>=<replaceable>HVSC base dir</replaceable></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Default: The value of the HVSC_BASE environment variable</para>
	      <para>Example #1: stilview -l=C:\Music\HVSC\ -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid</para>
	      <para>Example #2: stilview -l=../HVSC/ =-e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid</para>
	      <para>Example #3: stilview -l -e=/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid</para>

	      <para>This is where you tell STILView where it can find the HVSC base directory (the
	       path to the directory has to be specified in the form required by your
	       operating system, eg. C:\Music\HVSC under Windows, /home/lala/HVSC under UNIX).
	       STILView will then try to locate the STIL.txt file in the /DOCUMENTS/
	       subdirectory of that directory. If this option is not specified (or if -l is
	       specified without a base directory), STILView will try to extract the path of
	       the HVSC base directory from the HVSC_BASE environment variable. If that
	       environment variable doesn't exist or is pointing to a location where there's
	       no STIL.txt file in a DOCUMENTS directory, STILView fails. If the HVSC_BASE
	       environment variable exists and is valid, and this option is specified, the
	       directory specified with this option is used as the HVSC base directory instead
	       of the environment variable.</para>

	      <para>In example #1 the HVSC base directory is located in C:\Music\HVSC\ on the hard
	       drive of a Windows PC, in example #2 it is located in the HVSC directory of
	       the current directory's parent directory of a UNIX system. In example #3 the
	       HVSC base directory is not specified with the option, so it is assumed that
	       the HVSC_BASE environment variable contains the path to it. In reality,
	       specifying the -l option in example #3 is redundant, and can be omitted.</para>

	      <para>When specified, it prints out a whole bunch of things that a) test most of the
	       functionality of STILView, and b) show what STILView is capable of retrieving
	       from STIL. In example #1, the demo is printed with the STIL info coming from a
	       default STIL entry, then STILView quits. In example #2, the demo is printed
	       taking the STIL info from the specified STIL entry of /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid
	       (instead of the default SID file), then interactive mode is entered.</para>

	      <para>When this option is specified, STIL entries will not be printed for the given
	       SID tune (but section-global entries and BUG entries will be printed, provided
	       they exist and other options did not turn their output off). At a minimum, the
	       -e option has to be specified for this option to work. Example #1 will print
	       out the section-global comment and the BUG entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid,

	      <para>Asks for the portion of a STIL entry referring to one particular tune. If tune
	       number 0 is given, it retrieves all of the entry. Combined with the -f option,
	       these two options can retrieve any portion of a STIL entry, including a single
	       field in a specific subtune's entry.</para>

	      <para>For further details about this option, see the explanation of the -f option.</para>

	      <para>Example #1 retrieves all of the STIL entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid,
	       including the section-global comment and the BUG entry (if any), but since the
	       default value for this option is 0, it might as well be omitted in this
	       example. Example #2 retrieves only the TITLE field of the first subtune's
	       entry for /Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid (and not the section- global comment or the
	       BUG entry), while example #3 retrieves all of the STIL entry for tune #12 of

	       #1 this is the only piece of info that gets printed on the screen, in example

COMMENT: "[...] I started exploring pentatonic things in B flat minor over
         different bass notes, B flat, D flat, G flat and A flat. The middle
         section went into F (I think) at double tempo to liven things up. I
         was pleased with the tune......" (RH)

   COMMENT: "[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music was Gary Liddon's idea.
            [...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told Rob Hubbard
            to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side of the Moon
            by Pink Floyd." (Info from Matt Furniss.)
            "The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and Romeo/Juliet
            music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such as end of
            level, extra life etc..."
            "Delta was based on this minimalist composition technique inspired by
            Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard too do and required
            some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was tedious to
            debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite liked the
            other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week period....." (RH)
            According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
            to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
            insane.
