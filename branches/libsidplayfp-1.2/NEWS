0.3.0 2011-09-24

* integrated Lorenz testsuite
* added doxygen documentation
* simplified the Event Scheduler
* ported the MOS6526 emulation from jsiplay2, passes the whole CIA suite
* reworked the 6510 emulation, passes the whole Lorenz suite

API changes:

deprecated methods Event::cancel and Event::schedule in favor of
EventContext::cancel and EventContext::schedule

deprecated sidplay2::timebase, it always returns 1



0.2.0 2011-08-13

* ported reSIDfp engine from jsidplay2 featuring two pass resampler
  and triangular dithering and new filter model based on reSID's one
* improved CIA emulation, fixes a bunch of tunes with digi samples
* few fixes to the 6510 core based on Lorenz testuite
* added support for PSIDv3 tunes
* Updated reSID to the 1.0rc1 version (see the NEWS file in the resid dir)
* Added version defines

API changes:

deprecated method filter(const sid_filter_t *filter) from reSID builder
deprecated method filter(const sid_filterfp_t *filter) from reSIDfp builder

added method bias(const double dac_bias) to the reSID builder
The bias is given in millivolts, and a maximum reasonable control range is
approximately -500 to 500 (Actually from testing the value seems to be
in volts so dac_bias value should be in the range -0.5 - 0.5)

added methods filter6581Curve(const double filterCurve) which sets the filter
curve for 6581 chip filter in a range from 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark)
(default 0.5) and filter8580Curve(const double filterCurve) which sets the
filter frequency for 8580 chip (default 12500)

SidDatabase.h does not include SidTuneMod.h anymore



0.1.0 2010-11-10

you can read a summary of changes from the original libsidplay2
at http://www.bel.fi/~alankila/c64-sw/index-cpp.html

other changes includes:
* audio output is now signed 16bit
* added sampling method and fast sampling parameters and removed precision
  and samplingFormat from the sid_config_t structure
* removed filter(const sid_filter_t*) from sidbuilder class
  and made it builder specific
* removed optimization method from builders
* rewritten ini parser to be locale agnostic and use it only internally
* headers are now installed under $(includedir)/sidplayfp
* libsidplay and libsidutils are merged in a single library
* two resid builders (original and distortion patched)
