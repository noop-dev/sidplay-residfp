0.2.0 2011-06-02
* Update reSID to the 1.0rc1 version (see the NEWS file in the resid dir)
* Ported Dag Lem's R-2R ladder network emulation from Jsidplay2 into reSIDfp
* Added version defines

API changes:

added method bias(const double dac_bias) to the reSID builder
The bias is given in millivolts, and a maximum reasonable control range is
approximately -500 to 500 (Actually from testing the value seems to be
in volts so dac_bias value should be in the range -0.5 - 0.5)

the reSID builder's filter(const sid_filter_t *filter) method does nothing

SidDatabase.h does not include SidTuneMod.h anymore
